    "# 2. Black-Scholes Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements and evaluates the standard Black-Scholes model as the baseline for option pricing. Despite its simplifying assumptions, the Black-Scholes model remains a foundational benchmark for option pricing. In this notebook, we use it to evaluate market prices and establish a baseline before introducing more flexible models like Heston.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "- Implement analytical formulas for Black-Scholes pricing of **vanilla** European options (calls and puts).\n",
    "- Compute theoretical option prices using real market data.\n",
    "- Calculate key **Greeks**: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing theoretical prices with observed market mid prices.\n",
    "- Visualize volatility surfaces and model pricing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "1. **Environment & Data**: Load cleaned options dataset and libraries.\n",
    "2. **Black-Scholes Functions**: Pricing formula and Greeks.\n",
    "3. **Application to Market Data**: Compute theoretical prices and compare with mid prices.\n",
    "4. **Visualizations**: Price surfaces, Greeks, and model error heatmaps.\n",
    "5. **Conclusion**: Performance analysis and motivation for moving beyond Black-Scholes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note* This introduction is done mainly in a very theoretical framwork. If you want to skip the derivation, go directly to section 3."

    "### 2.1. Model assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model make the following assumptions about the assets:\n",
    "- Risk-free rate: The rate of return on the riskless asset is constant.\n",
    "- Random walk: The instantaneous log return of the stock price is an infinitesimal random walk with constant drift and volatility.\n",
    "- The stock does not pay a dividend.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the market asumpitons that are made are:\n",
    "- No arbitrage opportunity (no way to make a riskless profit in excess of the risk-free rate).\n",
    "- Ability to borrow and lend any amount of cash at the riskless rate.\n",
